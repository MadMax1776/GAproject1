This is a test for the name change.

//////////=============Google API======================================
Getting the google APIs to work was by far the most frustrating part of this
project for me. I started out testing all of the API manually through the
web browser/html/javascript file which was pretty time consuming. I was nervous I was going to have to scrap my project theme and do something else besides google books but while surveying google's exhaustive information about their APIs, I found some code that linked to a Harry Potter book. I copied and pasted that into my test file and it actually pulled data. This was late Saturday evening. On Sunday, I registered my API key with them and attempted to use my API key at the end of the url like their instructions suggested to pull the data I was wanting. It wasn't working so  I later found a great API testing tool called postman and used that to ensure my google books
search APIs were working properly. This was huge for me because it enabled me to know that the API was legit and that it was actually my code that was messed up. The information I was getting on google's website was pretty confusing because it was geared to actual apps/companies that are wanting to sell books and other products with their APIs. Therefore, a lot of the information was geared towards getting your API key and registering your app with google. It wasn't until Saturday afternoon that I realized that just to pull information and embed it into your app you don't have to register it with them. The API is public and from what I was reading, the API key and registration is more for financial/business purposes. I'm not 100% sure that my API key is worthless though because the search function on my app only started working when I generated my key and enabled the google books API. I plan on testing to see if that's the case after this project is done/graded but I'm nervous that if I experiment with it now that I'll break my code. I enabled my google books search function by going to the google cloud platform library and searching for the google books API and then enabling that API. I'm still a little confused on that because the API was working in my postman before I registered the API but I'm not going to run the risk of breaking my stuff by deleting my Booky-API-Key off of the google cloud platform. The hardest part overall about working with google apis for a (in experienced web developer terms) "simple project" like this is just finding that basic information that you need to just pull the book info. So much of it is geared towards more complex objectives such as google's book-shelving feature where you can basically save books that you are interested in. Overall, I'm glad I chose to work with google APIs for this project because I think it will help me a lot in the future with designing dynamic products.
